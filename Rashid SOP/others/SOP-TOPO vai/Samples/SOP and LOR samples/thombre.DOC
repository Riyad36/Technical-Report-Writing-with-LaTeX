%\section*{Introduction}

I, Rahul Thombre, am a senior student of the Bachelor of Technology program
in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology,
Bombay. I am applying for graduate studies in Computer Science leading to a
Ph.D. I see this as a first step towards achieving my career objective of
research in an academic environment.

%\section*{Academic Background}

I have excelled in academics right from my school days. In school, I
consistently used to secure one of the top positions in the class.
In my twelfth standard examinations, I was placed in the merit position at
an All India level. I have always been attracted towards subjects that
draw upon one's  analytical abilities. Thus, Mathematics and Physics were
my favorite subjects. I was placed among the top 1\% of the candidates who
appeared for the National Search Examination in Physics all over
India. Later, I secured the 97$^{\mbox{th}}$ position among the 80,000
candidates who appeared throughout India for the Joint Entrance Examination. 
This examination is conducted by the IIT's, the premier engineering
institutions of India, for selecting the best of Indian talent.

%\section*{Computer Science Background}

The undergraduate program at IIT aims to strike a balance between the
theoretical as well as the practical aspects of Computer Science. This has
given me a sound understanding of the fundamentals at both the theoretical
as well as practical levels.

I have performed reasonably well in my undergraduate courses at IIT, but
since IIT admits only the best students throughout the country, I 
believe, in view of the competitive atmosphere, that the grades secured
should not be considered in an absolute sense.

During the course of the B.Tech. program I have developed a keen interest
in the fields of Computer Graphics, Algorithms and Operating
Systems. At present I am working under the guidance of Dr.\ Sharat Chandran 
on my home paper titled {\em Physically Based Modeling}. As a junior, I had
presented a seminar on {\em Associative--Commutative Matching and
Unification}. I have included a brief summary of both these separately.

%\section*{Purpose of Doctoral Study and Career Goals}

During the course of my education at IIT,  I  have  realized  and
felt  convinced that my true liking and aptitude lies in research
and teaching. Research and teaching go  hand  in  hand.  Teaching
gives one a sense of constructive participation in the education
process. Research enables a person to  stay  in  touch  with  the
latest  advances,  while  making  one's  own contributions to the
field. I have also had a good deal of teaching experience as an 
undergraduate teaching assistant during my junior year for the freshman
course {\em Computer Programming and Utilization}. I have included a brief
description of this and relevant certificates to substantiate my claim.

I believe that graduate education is not merely a continuation of
college  studies.  I think that  graduate  education  is  process,  in
which the student learns how to do independent research. 

My decision to apply to UNIV is based on a careful examination of
the department bulletin and the research interests of the faculty
members. I have contacted PROF, who has encouraged me to apply.
I would really love working under his guidance for my Ph.D.
I believe that graduate education at your University will enhance
my  knowledge,  give me wide exposure and develop my abilities to
do independent research. I  consider  myself  an enthusiastic and 
hardworking person, and I am sure that my stay your university will be a 
very fruitful one.
