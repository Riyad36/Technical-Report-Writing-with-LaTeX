{\bf \LARGE Statement of Purpose} \\
\end{center}

	My interest in Computer Science stemmed from  programming
in High School, during which period
I read introductory books on Algorithms by Dromey
and Wirth. It was this informal literary venture that introduced me for the 
first time to {\em doing things as efficiently as possible}. I found this
an intellectually stimulating exercise and resolved to pursue a career in 
Computer Science. \\

	 Abstract Mathematics has always fascinated me. The course
work during my B.Tech. program has given me exposure to a wide range of 
advanced mathematical techniques and also provided an insight into
Theoretical Computer Science. 
	In particular, the concepts I acquired in Graph Theory and Complexity theory,
during the courses in {\bf Discrete Structures}, {\bf Data
Structures and Algorithms}, and {\bf Theory of Computation}, have interested me
immensely. 

	My B.Tech. Seminar included a literature survey on {\bf Parallel
and Randomized Algorithms} and my B.Tech. Project is in the area of 
{\bf Graph--Drawing Algorithms}. 
These have given me a chance to do research in the form of proving lower
bounds on efficiency of algorithms, design of graph algorithms and 
combinatorial approaches to planarity of graphs.
It has been a wonderful first--hand
experience in problem--solving, working with small examples
to begin with, developing an intuition for the problem, coming up with
conjectures, constructing counterexamples against them, modifying the 
conjectures and (if I am lucky!) proving them. The satisfaction one derives 
from this experience, is in my opinion, the greatest reward for research. 

	With the purpose of honing my mathematical background for these fields
further, I have taken the elective {\bf Algorithms and Complexity} and 
registered for courses in {\bf Abstract Algebra}, {\bf Combinatorial
Optimization}, and {\bf Information Theory and Coding} for the coming semester. 
Currently, I am also attending a lecture series on {\bf Markov Chains} and
 their application in the {\bf Uniform Generation of Matroids}. \\

	I strongly feel that Algorithms and Complexity theory are the core
subjects in Computer Science. These fields have both a mathematical flavor as
well as potential for in--depth research which draws me towards them.
Hence I envisage myself, a few
years from now, as researching on the lines of Theoretical Computer Science,
preferably in an academic environment.

	I have a strong inclination towards teaching. Having delivered lectures
during the Workshops and Seminars conducted by the department at the Institute
level and doing a teaching assistantship for an introductory course in
programming, has built in me a lot of confidence and strengthened my
resolve to teach. I believe (and this has often been reinforced by my B.Tech.
Project advisor) that teaching a subject is the best way to learn more about
it. I would love to teach the courses in Theoretical Computer Science that I
have taken during my undergraduate studies to enhance my understanding of
these fields and get a better grasp on the basics. 
	
	A few years back, Theoretical Computer Science was in its incipient
stage in India and the main research work was affiliated with the 
Mathematics department. Recently however, a lot of young post--graduates
have returned
to the country and are pursuing research in academic environments. IIT--Bombay and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay now have 
an excellent group in Theoretical Computer Science. I would like to come back
for teaching and work as a part of this group. \\
	
	I have heard from IIT Alumni and faculty about the Theoretical Computer
Science department at the Stanford University. Also, my advisors have recommended the
University on the basis of the faculty interests, the research done in the 
past, the work currently in progress,
 and the excellent performance of the students who have graduated
from your department. In my course work and literature surveys at IIT, 
I have had a chance to read the
publications of the faculty, especially in the field of {\bf Approximation
Algorithms} and {\bf Parallel Algorithms}.
I find that the graduate program at your University
suits my interests extremely well. 

	I realize that the purpose I have in mind would require a constant and
a well--directed effort over the years to come. It is with this mental
preparation that I desire to join the Ph.D. program at your department. \\

	In conclusion I do hope that I will be given a fair chance to realize
my objectives by being granted admission with financial aid at your 
institution. My academic credentials combined with my research experience and
interest in the area of study that I have selected, give me the confidence to
dain that if provided with such an opportunity, I would acquit myself
creditably in your stimulating academic environment and thereby contribute my
own mite to the academic milieu at your department.
