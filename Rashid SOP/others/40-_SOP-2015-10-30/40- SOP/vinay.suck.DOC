Dear Professor,

	I am a final (fourth) year Bachelor of Technology student
of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of
Technology (I. I. T.), Bombay. I am keen on joining the Graduate
program (MS / PhD, preferably PhD) at your University, and have
received the application materials. I have made a keen perusal of
the technical brochure provided along with the application form,
and have noted that your research interests concur with my areas of
interest, which are :

	(1) Artificial Intelligence, specifically Learning and
	    Natural Language Processing.
	(2) Neural networks and neural modeling.

	Sir, I am writing to you because I wish to have some more
specific information regarding the research activities in these
fields at your University, and my chances of admission to the
Graduate program at your University. I would be grateful if you
could spare some time in evaluating my credentials, which I have
summarized below (I have also enclosed a copy of the bio-data form
which I had earlier sent to your University) :

	I am doing my undergraduate study at I. I. T. Bombay, one
of the premier institutes of advanced technical education in India.
I have maintained a consistent Grade Point Average, my Cumulative
Performance Index being 8.43 (on a scale of 10).

	My credit seminar (junior thesis) was on "Human and
Artificial Intelligence". I concentrated on some aspects of
intelligence, especially Knowledge Representation, Memory, and
Learning, both from the human and the computer perspective. It
involved an extensive literature survey, and a presentation at the
end.

	My final-year project (senior thesis) is on "Word
Recognition and Spell Checking using ART-based Neural Networks".
Working under the Adaptive Resonance Theory paradigm (developed by
Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter), a neural network is to be
trained to recognize English words, and make intelligent
suggestions in case of spelling or grammatical mistakes. We are
also studying other models of learning for this purpose. My guide
is Professor Pushpak Bhattacharya.

	As my financial resources are limited, I would be
requesting financial aid from your Department or University, in the
form of TA / RA / Fellowship. I have some teaching experience, as I
am a course assistant for a Fresher course, "Computer Programming
and Utilization". This involves engaging weekly tutorial classes,
evaluating term papers, programming assignments, etc.

	Sir, I would be extremely grateful if you would devote some
of your valuable time in making a frank appraisal of my chances of
gaining admission to your University with full financial aid. I
would really like to work under your guidance for my post-graduate
studies. I shall be eagerly awaiting your reply.

	Thanking you,

				Yours Sincerely,
				Vinay Gupta

                         STATEMENT  OF  PURPOSE
                        ------------------------
It is after a good deal of self-evaluation that I have decided to pursue 
graduate studies in Computer Science leading to a doctorate. This decision
followed naturally after carefully considering my academic background,
the areas of my interest, and my ultimate professional ambition, which is to
pursue a research career, either as a teaching faculty member, or in an 
R & D department of the industry.

My undergraduate education at IIT Bombay has provided me with a strong 
and comprehensive background in Computer Science. The curriculum included
all the  basic courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete 
Structures, Computer Organization and Design, Systems Programming, Theory of
Computation, etc.

I had always been fascinated by the field of Artificial Intelligence, which
is why I chose the topic of "Human and Artificial Intelligence" for my junior
thesis. The literature survey that this entailed exposed me to the fundamental
concepts, as also the research work in progress, in the various domains of
Artificial Intelligence. I concentrated on issues involved in  Natural Language
Processing and Knowledge Representation.

My B. Tech. project (senior thesis) is "Word Recognition, Spell Checking  and
Correction using ART-based neural networks". We are investigating the use of
neural networks, configured under the Adaptive Resonance Theory paradigm, for
the task of detecting spelling mistakes in English text and generating good
suggestions for incorrectly spelled words.  This guided independent work has
given me a good understanding of the theoretical, experimental and computational
skills required in Computer Science.



I have been a teaching assistant for the introductory course "Computer
Programming and Utilization" conducted by Prof. R.D. Kumar of the Computer
Science department. I have also helped in organizing, and given a lecture
on the "VI" editor, during the UNIX workshop conducted by the Computer
Science and Engineering Association of our Department. 

	There are two reasons why I believe that graduate study in a reputed 
department, such as yours, is important for a person aspiring for a research
career. Firstly, working for a thesis under the guidance of an expert whose
work can serve as a model is the most effective method of transforming
a student into a largely independent researcher making significant original
contributions.  Secondly, the emphasis of graduate study on intensive and
independent study of a specialized area is an ideal way of
making a student capable of reaching the frontiers of knowledge in a subfield
quickly and keeping abreast of the latest developments.

I feel that  			with its comprehensive facilities and competent faculty
doing quality research work in the field of Artificial Intelligence will be
the ideal place for me to pursue graduate studies. The working atmosphere
of a vigorously active department will be helpful in motivating me towards
excellence.

      In short, I believe that a good graduate program is an essential step for
realising my professional ambition of becoming a competent researcher. I also
believe that I possess the motivation, intellectual ability and preparation
to do justice to a demanding graduate program. My excellent undergraduate
record, and my high GRE scores are testimony to that.
I, therefore, look forward to joining your department as a graduate student.
