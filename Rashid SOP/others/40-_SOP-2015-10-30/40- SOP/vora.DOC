\

After carefully considering my aptitude, interests, the nature of my
training and my ultimate professional ambition, I have decided to
pursue a {\em Doctoral degree} in Computer Science, in my fields of
interest -- {\em Computer Graphics} and {\em Computational Geometry},
ultimately leading to a career in teaching and research. As a
statement of purpose of my graduate study, I describe here my academic
background, research interests and career goals.

\ 

I have excelled in academics at every stage of my education. In the
twelve years of my schooling, I have always been ranked first or second in
my class. I stood  $111^{th}$ out of 100,000 candidates in the
highly competitive examination for admission to the undergraduate
program at the Indian Institutes of Technology. In the Regional
Mathematics Olympiad 1990, I was ranked $6^{th}$ in my home
state of Maharashtra.

\

The excellent undergraduate program at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay not only provided me with a strong foundation of
Computer Science fundamentals, but also exposed me to various fields
of Computer Science. I have always been interested in problems
involving visualization. At IIT, this led to an inclination towards
Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry. I substantiated my
knowledge in these areas by choosing graduate level electives in
Advanced Computer Graphics and Geometric Algorithms. I am currently
working on my year long B.Tech Project (senior thesis) titled {\em
Triangulations in 3 Dimensions}, under the guidance of Dr. Sharat
Chandran. In this thesis we are looking at decompostions of polyhedra
into simplices with an emphasis on obtaining well shaped tetrahedra.

I am also interested in Multimedia technology. In my third year, I
presented a home paper titled {\em Multimedia Databases} under the
guidance of Dr. S. Seshadri. In this paper, our study was focussed on
issues involved in the storage and real time retrieval of multimedia
objects in a multi-user environment.

My years at IIT Bombay have given me substantial teaching
experience. I have delivered lectures at Workshops on Unix conducted
by the department and have been a teaching assistant for an
introductory course in programming. This has built in me a lot of
confidence that is required to excel as a teacher. 

\

Though my experiences in IIT Bombay have provided me with a strong
foundation in my fields of interest, a good graduate program is
necessary not only to increase my knowledge in these fields but to
mould me into a good researcher. I am fully aware of the hard work and
perseverance required for a successful career in research and I
believe that I have the aptitude and drive to meet the challenge.

The Graduate program at SUNY, Stony Brook is fully suited to my
goals. Graphics and Computational Geometry are strong areas of
research at Stony Brook. I have found the faculty and the research
work to be quite impressive. I feel that to be associated with this
group would stand me in good stead throughout my research career. I
have also been impressed by the computing facilities available at
Stony Brook for research and education. My B.Tech Project advisor has
also strongly encouraged me to apply to your program.  I am confident
that given the opportunity, I will be able to make significant
contributions to the ongoing research at Stony Brook.

\

I corresponded with Prof. Arie Kaufman whose encouraging reply
reinforced my decision to apply to Stony Brook. 

\

I look forward to joining SUNY, Stony Brook as a graduate student at
your esteemed department.
