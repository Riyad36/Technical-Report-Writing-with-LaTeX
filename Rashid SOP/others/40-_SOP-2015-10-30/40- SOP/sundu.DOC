\

My early fascination for computers (since high school), combined with
a strong liking for analytical subjects inspired me to seek admission
to one of the best and most competitive Computer Science undergraduate
programs in India --- the B.Tech program in IIT Bombay. I was
succesful in this endeavour, being ranked 113th among around 100,000
students in the entrance exams to the IITs. In IIT, a very strong
curriculum, introduced me to a wide range of subjects in Computer
Science, with a strong emphasis on theoretical fundamentals.  I have
always believed that a subject is understood better when one actually
sees an abstract theory being realized by a practical system. The
various demanding laboratory courses and projects in the B.Tech
program at IIT, have provided me with a better understanding of
Computer Science.  This belief has led to my growing interest in
computer systems, and I have consistently performed well in my
laboratory courses. I have also, as part of a campus wide systems
support group, been involved in compiling and installing various
software and systems.

\

Given these practical interests, my theoretical background, my
aptitude and academic potential for graduate study (indicated by my
GRE General score of (V 700, Q 790, A 780) and Computer Science
Subject score in the 98th percentile), I feel that pursuing a PhD
degree in Computer Science is a step in the right direction towards my
long term career goals.

\

Thirty years from now, I want to be able to look back at the
accomplishments of my life and feel a sense of satisfaction.
Satisfaction, because my work made a significant impact in my field.
And if I can achieve this goal I will consider my career a
success. Over the past four years, I have become absolutely convinced
that the path towards this goal will involve leveraging my current
skills and abilities to make significant contributions to improve the
understanding of systems and concepts in the field of Computer
Science. Six or seven years from now, I see myself as part of a
leading research group, contributing my bit to the field of Computer
Science. A PhD in Computer Science, is therefore a natural first step
towards this goal.

\

I plan to work towards a PhD in the field of {\bf Distributed Systems
and Networking}. I have become interested in this area during the
course of my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, through a series of
research and project experiences.

\

In my junior year, I presented a home paper on ``Wormhole Routing in
Interconnection Networks.''  Currently, I am in the midst of my year
long B.Tech thesis, titled ``Distribution Strategies for the
Satisfiability Problem,'' guided by Prof. G. Sivakumar (PhD,
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign).  For this thesis, I am
writing a distributed solution for the satisfiability problem, on a
network of workstations. My work will involve studying various
distributed computing techniques and writing a distributed version of
existing sequential solutions to satisfiability. Moreover, this
semester I have undertaken as an Operating Systems course project, a
study of implementation issues in ``Group Communication in the {\em
Amoeba} Distributed Operating System'' and will be crediting a
Postgraduate elective --- ``Foundations of Parallel Computation'' in
my final (next) semester.

\

In my opinion, the effective communication of ideas is an important
part of any research career.  During my undergraduate years in IIT, I
have been fortunate to have had some experience in teaching basic
Computer Science.  In my junior year, I was a teaching assistant for
an institute level introductory course in programming, ``CS 101:
Computer Programming and Utilization,'' for freshmen. The work
involved conducting tutorials, grading assignments, and providing
assistance during practical sessions.

\

In my junior and senior years, I have been the Technical Coordinator,
and subsequently General Seceratary of the Computer Science and
Engineering Association, IIT Bombay. In this capacity, I have been
actively involved in planning, organizing and lecturing at, various
workshops on UNIX aimed at both technical and lay audiences.  These
experiences have been extremely rewarding, and I am sure they will
help me in any teaching duties as a graduate student, and later on in 
my career.

\

I am confident that my strong motivation, my undergraduate experiences
and my analytical aptitude will help me to measure up to the rigours
of graduate study. I am looking forward to make my contributions to
the research going on at Dartmouth.
