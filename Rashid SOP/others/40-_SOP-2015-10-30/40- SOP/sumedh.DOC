{\Large {\bf My goals}}\\
I am applying to the PhD program in Computer Science at Brown University.
After considering my aptitude and the 
 type of work that I enjoy most, I am convinced that
I want to take up a career in research in Computer Science.
A PhD is just one step towards realising this goal.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My preparation for the same}}\\
My formal introduction to Computer Science began at IIT-Bombay. Under
its excellent faculty, I got exposed to  the entire spectrum of
Computer Science. In an environment that is intensely competitive, and where
research goes hand-in-hand with learning, I also got a lot of drill in
both theoretical research work and implementation, thus laying a sound
foundation for graduate study.

My academic and co-curriculur record has been consistently good. Throughout
school as well as now, I have been at or near the top of my class. I have
listed some of my achievements, on the attached resum\'{e}.
What I would like to stress most  however is the fact that I have been
{\em consistent} in {\em all} academic or co-curriculur (and even 
extracurriculur) tasks that I have undertaken.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My primary interests}}\\
 I have always loved problems which
 involve plenty of visualisation. At IIT, this resulted in
 an inclination towards {\bf Computer Graphics} and 
{\bf Computational Geometry}, and also Algorithms.
 {\em These are the subjects that I
want to pursue in my graduate study}.

I chose the elective {\em
Computer Graphics} and a graduate level course {\em Algorithms and
Complexity} this semester, in line with these interests. My B.Tech. Project
 (home paper), under {\bf Dr.Sharat Chandran},
is on {\bf Visible Surface Determination} (hidden surface removal), a very
popular topic in Computational Geometry.


\ \\
{\Large {\bf Why Brown University ?}}\\
It would be a clich\'{e} to say that all fields in 
Computer Science are highly interlinked.
 I have  experienced this myself, since frequently, while working on a
problem in one field, I have (through abstraction/ reduction/ analogy)
landed up looking at another problem, that one would normally put under
a different field altogether.

Hence, two criteria that I considered while selecting a university
for my Ph.D. were
\begin{enumerate}
\item the university must be very strong in {\bf Computational Geometry} 
and/or {\bf Computer Graphics} (my primary interests), and
\item it must be fairly good, if not exceptional, in other fields of
Computer Science too (especially, algorithms and combinatorics).
\end{enumerate}
Brown University more than satisfies these criteria. My B.Tech.
Project guide,
Dr.Sharat Chandran also strongly recommended it. An added attraction is
its participation in the
Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific 
Visualisation.

There is one more ({\em and the most compelling}) reason.
In my B.Tech. Project, my guide and I are
 concentrating on developing better methods 
for the moving/ multiple viewpoint case of hidden 
surface removal. The preliminary
 ideas that have emerged out of this effort use a
result on {\em Dynamic planar point location} by
{\bf Prof.Roberto Tamassia}. The {\em line sweep} technique is the other
major component in these ideas, and it was from {\bf Prof.Preparata}'s 
book on Computational Geometry, that I first learnt it.
 {\em The fact that  both are from Brown University
 convinced me that  Brown University is the natural
choice in realising my graduate goals.}
 Subsequently I  corresponded with Prof.Tamassia, and his
encouraging reply reinforced my decision to apply to Brown.

It would be a pleasure to continue my current research focus at Brown under
their supervision. At the same time, I am sure that many other problems which
the Brown CS department is currently focussing on, would be equally 
interesting to work on.


\ \\
{\Large {\bf What I plan to do at Brown}}\\
I plan to carry on advanced study of both Computer Graphics and 
Computational Geometry, as well as related fields (e.g. algorithms),
not only through coursework but also by
 {\em participating in one of the several ongoing projects}.
This will also give me the opportunity to
  contribute my bit to the understanding of the fields which interest me
so much.

 I am keen that 
the output of my PhD (and in fact, any PhD),
be well worth the time and effort spent on it. For the reasons mentioned
above, I am sure that Brown University
will provide me the right environment for this. 

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Financial Aid}}\\
I would be fully dependent on aid to finance my graduate studies.
 If I am granted an assistantship, then given my long term goals, 
a research assistantship would be
an ideal experience for me. I also have some experience as a teaching 
assistant. Not only have I enjoyed it, but the students have also appreciated
it. This makes me confident that I will be a good teacher also.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf In conclusion...}}\\
I am aware that Brown University expects very high standards from its students.
On my part, I can assure you of hard work. I believe that my enthusiasm will 
enable me to meet those expectations. My consistency in all previous academic
and co-curriculur activities is what gives me confidence when I say this.

Eagerly looking forward to a long and mutually profitable 
association with the Computer Science
department of Brown University,
